# asc-ImageJ-LayerThickness
<p>These ImageJ macros (<a href="https://github.com/peterjlee/asc-ImageJ-LayerThickness"Â  Title = "Applied Superconductivity Center Layer Thickness Macros Directory" >link</a>) measure the minimum wall thickness of open or closed objects from the perspective of each pixel on the interior or exterior of a wall. If the wall is broken (incomplete) there is a version that uses an interior object to define the open and closed regions (this also allows a measurement of the percent of wall that is open). A detailed explanation of the two macros is provided in this presentation: <a href="http://fs.magnet.fsu.edu/~lee/asc/ImageJUtilities/ASC-Macros/LayerThickness/Minimum%20wall%20thickness%20macro_060816.pdf">PDF</a>. In the illustration below we illustrate the impact of the choice of direction for this macro.</p><p><img src="http://fs.magnet.fsu.edu/~lee/asc/ImageJUtilities/IA_Images/ThicknessDirectionComparison_284x255_pal64.png" alt="Illustration of the importance of direction when choosing mode for layer thickness macro." width="284" height="255" /></p>
